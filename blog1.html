    <h1>My choice about the Chatbot tool</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I have always been interested in subjects related to the interaction between user versus machine and the facilities that this can provide in our lives.
    In conversations with friends who work with technology, on specialized websites, in most job openings, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are words that are always present.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Putting these interesting topics together, I started to study chatbot. It is a computational intelligence used to conduct an online conversation via text or text to speech between machine and human, that is, you need help or information, and at least in the first interests, this computational intelligence through a robot will provide you the necessary guidelines.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Incredible, don’t you think? It has already come to my mind to reduce costs for companies, to reduce the average service time by thinking of a call center… the dream is that any executive who thinks about productivity with lean costs. Therefore, I tried to understand more who are the companies that stand out in this branch and what are the most popular tools for me to choose which one I will specialize in…</p>
    <br>
    <p>I started and understand more about IBM Watson, without a doubt very interesting and complete. SAP has a very powerful tool, SAP Conversational AI. I can’t help mentioning Microsoft with its easy-to-use Azure Bot Service tool to the point where the company provides workshops like Chatbot-in-a-Day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All of these tools will undoubtedly deliver extraordinary results for companies and help drive the digital transformation through a quick return on investment, but I still wasn’t decided on my choice until I came across AWS Lex, the Amazon’s tool. It is complete, intuitive, and very robust and from the next post, I will present its power in more detail.</p>
